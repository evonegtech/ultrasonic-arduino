# ultrasonic-arduino

We've decided to remake this old project for YouTube. This was one of the projects we did when we started learning about Arduino's years back. Hope you find it informational and amusing! :)

Parts Used:
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Arduino Nano compatible board
- 1602 LCD screen module (blue backlight)
- some breadboards and lots of jumper wires!
